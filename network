# Direct LAN

## Ethernet

*  In the past you would have to ensure that you used a cross over cable for a direct connection, however many devices now support patch cables and cross over cables interchangeably

*  On Ubuntu
    1.  `ifconfig` | `ifconfig -s -a` | `ip link` to see your available connections
        2.  Ethernet most often shows up as eth0, eth1, etc., but not always. Mine was identified as enp3s0.
            3.  `sudoedit /etc/network/interfaces`, sudoedit preserves your EDITOR enviornment

            Add the following,
            ```bash
            auto enp3s0
            iface enp3s0 inet static
            address 192.168.99.10
            netmask 255.255.255.0
            ```
            Reset

            * On Mac
                1. Open Network Preferences
                    2. Configure IPv4 Manually
                        3. Set IP address to 192.168.99.20
                            4. Set Subnet Mask to 255.255.255.0

                            From either computer `ping 192.168.99.xx` to make sure they see each other.

                            ## Dropbox 

                            The wifi (wlan) connection to router (which connects to the Dropbox server) is through a different gateway than the direct connection. Will Dropbox on both machines be able to discover each other?
                                *  Yes, but it takes a little while (~30 minutes for me) before LAN syn kicks in
                                    *  LAN sync is noticeable when clicking the dropbox tray icon it will say 'Downloading # files (LAN)'


                                    ## Linux serve SMB to Mac

                                    ```bash
                                    sudo apt-get install samba
                                    sudo smbpasswd -a darren
                                    sudo -e /etc/samba/smb.conf
                                    ```

                                    Add the following to the bottom:

                                    ```bash
                                    # Darren's share
                                    [tb2]
                                      comment = Share the 2 tb drive
                                        path = /media/darren/dbm_2tb
                                          valid users= darren
                                            read only = no
                                              guest ok = yes
                                              ```

                                              Then restart the daemon and check: 
                                              ```
                                              sudo services smbd restart
                                              testparm
                                              ```

                                              On mac:

                                              1.  Finder
                                              2.  Cmd + k
                                              3.  `smb://192.168.99.10`
                                              4.  Select connect as user. Enter darren and password used earlier.


ifconfig
ping broadcasat IP, e.g.
    ping 192.168.1.255
arp -a
